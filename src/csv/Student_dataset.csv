Kurtis Blow,Christmas Rappin',1979,disco,"'Twas the night before Christmas, and all through the house Hold it now! Wait, hold it. That's played out. Hit it!  Don't you give me all that jive about things you wrote before I's alive 'Cause this ain't 1823 -- ain't even 1970 Now I'm the guy named Kurtis Blow and Christmas is one thing I know So every year just about this time, I celebrate it with a rhyme Gonna shake it, gonna bake it, gonna make it good Gonna rock shock clock it through your neighborhood Gonna ring it, gonna sing it till it's understood My rappin' 'bout to happen like a knee you've been slapping Or a toe you've been tapping on a hunk of wood 'Bout a red-suited dude with a friendly attitude And a sleigh full of goodies for for the people on the block Got a long white beard, maybe looks kinda weird And if you ever see him, he can give you quite a shock Now people let me tell ya bout last year When the dude came flying over here Well, the hawk was out, snow's on the ground Folks stayed in to party down The beat was thumping on the box, and I was dancing in my socks And the drummer played at a solid pace And a taste of the bass was in my face And the guitar player laid down the heavy layer Of the funky, junky rhythm of the disco beat And the guy with the 88's started to participate And I could sure appreciate a sound so sweet You might also likeWe were all in the mood so we had a little food And a joke, and a smoke, and a little bit of wine When I thought I heard a hoof on the top of the roof Could it be or was it me? I was feeling super fine So I went to the attic where I thought heard the static On the chance that the prance was somebody breaking in But the noise on the top was a reindeer clop Just a trick St. Nick, and I let the sucker in He was rolly, he was poly, and I said, Holy moly! You got a lot of whiskers on your chinny chin chin He allowed he was proud of the hairy little crowd On the point of his jaw where the skin should've been Gets cool for a fool going out every Yule For a day on a sleigh when the cold went low So the beard may be weird but I'll never have it sheared 'Cause it's warm in the storm when it's ten below I said, You're right, it's cold tonight But can you stop for a drop before you go? He said, Why not if the music's hot? And I'll chance a dance beneath the mistletoe So he went downstairs and forgot his cares And he rocked the spot and danced like a pro And every young girl tried to rock his world But he boogie oogie oogied 'til he had to go And before he went, this fine old gent Brought a gift with a sift through his big red bags In the top or the bottom, he reached in and got 'em Toys for the boys, for the girls glad rags And the grownups got some presents too A new TV and a stereo A new Seville 'bout as blue as the sky The best that money couldn't buy 'Cause money could never ever buy the feeling The one that comes from not concealing The way you you feel about your friends And this is how the story ends The dude in red's back at the Pole Up north where everything is cold But if he were right here tonight He'd say, Merry Christmas and to all a good night12Embed"
